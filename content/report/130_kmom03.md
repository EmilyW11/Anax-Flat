It's fine with a grid, they are very helpful when lining up elements in any design context. I haven't ever used one making a webpage in this way, but I use Illustrator a lot for designs, and I always need a grid for help.  It does make it very easy to see if things are not lined up as they ought to be. <br><br>
It is also fine to use the horizontal lines too, as I have used them for lining up texts in other ways. It is helpful although I am not used to using even margins between text elements.  I usually try putting the headers a bit closer to their texts because if I stare too long at it, the header feels seperated.<br><br>
Along the way, I found how to put different types on different pages, so I have chosen different fonts for each page, some serif and some non-serif.  There isn't a whole lot of thought between each page other than to choose those I like better. I only chose those from the list in typography file.<br><br>
I would say no, not really.  As I said above, I work quite a bit with designs in Illustrator, and those I always need graphs to line up my pieces.  I would have a hard time without them, so I already have an appreciation for them.<br><br>
Yes, I am slowly beginning to see how LESS works, but I am not quite enjoying I thus far.  There does seem to be some advantages to using variables and functions to change things quickly rather than sifting through rows of CSS looking for the right element to change.  I don't think it's necessarily that difficult, but it is new, and I feel like I could have used more direction, or more to practice with.  Maybe I have missed some of the material and need to go back, but using it in projects is the best way to learn.<br><br>
This assignment wasn't difficult in the end, but I feel it lacked enough instruction.  It felt like a lot to be thrown when I still need a better grounding. As I said above, perhaps I missed a some resources along the way that would have been helpful.  To be honest I got pretty discouraged along the way, the thing that gave me the greatest difficulty wasn't the commands, but using the right element for the columns and the horizontal bars.
