===============================

I've worked with several web frameworks, Ruby on Rails, Django and Google's webapp (for python).  I built a whole site on ruby on rails but I never put it live, the same with Django. <br><br>
I don't have any experience with composer or make or anax flat, so this is all new and interesting.  The downloaded files for the command line use of composer didn't work for me, so I went to the website and used the windows set up installer.  It automatically put a line in the path, so I could continue.<br><br>
I'm trying to learn my way around Anax Flat, it feels fairly foreign.  Django and ruby on rails are quite different from each other but it wasn't hard jumping from one to the other, but this is completely different.<br><br>
The videos were a great complement to the articles although the articles were fine on their own.<br><br>
I had difficulty using the command line and git.  The problem was the cache and vendor weren't being ignored, so after quite a bit of time trying to figure it out, I just uploaded the files via the browser and left them out.  The tag wouldn't work right either, thought I wasn't logged in, so I added that on the website too.  Hopefully in the future it will work, so I don't have to keep track of everything that I've changed.  In any case, cool to try a new framework, I look forward to learning more.
