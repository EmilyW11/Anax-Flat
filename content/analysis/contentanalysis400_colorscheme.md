Content Analysis
===============================

<p>
I chose my three sites by looking at sites with web design trends for 2017.  I looked at some of my bookmarked sites, but most of them had so little color, very minimalist that I didn't think they were so interesting to analyze, but of course the minimalism has an effect on the user too.  I know the minimalism is popular right now, but for a course exercise on color, I wanted to find some sites that actually used color in interesting ways.  I decided to go out looking for sites I don't know, so I don't have any preconceptions about the page or the brand.  These three sites listed above, the first uses a rainbow of colors, the second uses color over the whole page in a way that makes the whole thing an experience, and the third has very muted colors.

Rentberry focuses on a purple them, which is an interesting choice that isn't used so often, but if you scroll down the page, there is a background block that uses a soft orange to yellow gradient.  Yellow is used as an accent color to draw attention to it, which makes the color palette complementary.  There are also bits of green in there too which pushes the palette to a split complementary system.
The fonts are sans-serif, and there appears to be one top headline the rest are the same size.

I find the color palette a bit confusing, it has cold and warm in large spaces, and not just with as an accent.  But it might work because the site seems to be aimed at two different crowds, tenants and landlords, so the split colors help convey this two-sided approach.  I don't know if the colors strengthen their brand or website (The logo is so small to be unmemorable), but it is an example of a sit choosing brighter colors.

Lighthouse Brewing uses shades of turquoise and accent colors of tan and red. This is a monochrome with the accents added to make it complementary.

<p>
The fonts are sans-serif with cursive for accents.  This site has several sizes for its headings down the page.  All use the same design.  White fonts on a dark background with cursive text above in a lighter shade of the background color.  It adds accent, but doesn't overwhelm with varying fonts.

The marine color scheme and decoration fits with the company brand name.  I get a sense of the site trying to stand out from everything else, just like they claim their product does. I think the website succeeds in conveying a feeling of quality, detail and immersion, all of which they want their product to be associated with.  I think it's a great site.

<p>
This site uses a very minimal color palette with grey, a pale gray background and orange-red for an accent color.  I would call this a neutral color palette
</p>
<p>
The site uses sans-serif and the front page is absent of any headers in the traditional sense.  The boxes with links are the closest things to headers that this site has.  The only real text is a short desciption of the site.
</p>
<p>
The minimalism, the colors, and the funky grid design, give a feeling of creative expression, and at the same time the color scheme doesn't take away from what is being presented as content, the photos of the artwork.  I noticed the social media links in the menu are in the accent while the site links are in a light gray.  Perhaps the site itself is secondary (maybe it's static) while their social media sites is where they put their latest projects.
