<h1>Speed Analysis</h1>
I chose three website listed on a site about design trends for 2018.  I didn't want to use one I go to often because there is stuff in the cache which makes it faster, although this effects subsequent reloads.  I chose them also because they are using the latest design trends and it's interesting to see how they might effect page loading.  Some of them might be built with this in mind, of course.<br><br>

I used Chrome to open the webpages on a windows 10 computer.  I did the first measurement on the first load of the page, to make sure it measured the load time for everything, not from the cache. The next two measurements were made from page reloads.  Then I chose two additional pages to load for measurements that were completely new links, not in-page references.  The measurements were made the same way.  The links were then entered into Google's page speed calculator for mobile and desktop and the values recorded.<br><br>

<a href=”Egwineco.com” target=”blank”>Egwineco.com</a><br>

This site had load times in the range of 1.5-3 seconds.  It's not super fast, but it's reasonable, but according to the google page analysis it needs image optimization and could make better use of the cache for reloads.  Also slow loading of some resources blocked loading of some of the page. <br><br>

<a href=”Zingle.me” target=”blank”>Zingle.me</a><br>

Initial load times on this site are quite high for some of the pages at over 8 seconds for the first loading.  They are much shorter for reloads. Compression, more caching and loading resources first that block rendering of above-the-fold content would help bring this down.<br><br>

<a href=”” target=”blank”>Beoplay.com</a><br>
[FIGURE src="image/beoplay.JPG" class="center" caption="beoplay."]
This sites loading times were fairly long too, between 1.6 and 6 seconds.  This page uses two redirects and could also benefit from better use of caching.<br><br>

None of these webpages had very good marks from google or very fast load times.  The same things were mentioned in all three as I said above – better use of caching, compression, loading rendering blocking scripts first, minify javascript.  Two of them needed better server responses too.  I ran all the measurements in Firefox as well, but the caching didn't seem to have as much effect on load times as they did with Chrome.  <br><br>

The pages in average speed from fastest to slowest was egwine, beoplay, and then zingle, and the pages ranking from highest to lowest was egwine, zingle and beoplay.  All of these sites, which I have taken from a site discussing 2018 web design trends, all scored miserably on Google's speed analysis.  I would say that none of the web designers considered this when the made their sites, but maybe looking good and being trendy is far more important than speed.  Certainly giving users an “experience” is mentioned over and over again, not being fast and lightweight.<br><br>

For fun I picked a few extra sites to get some data on, since I don't know a lot about this, and my own numbers are affected by my not-so-superfast internet connection and that most of these sites are probably overseas. I have blockers on my usual browser, so that may be affecting load times as well.  Also, I sometimes visit sites with lots of pictures, and I know that can take longer.  On the whole, these sites also scored low on Google's speed analysis, except for one standout, amazon.com's desktop had a much higher score.<br><br>

For the reasons I mentioned above, I may have slightly more tolerance for waiting than some other users.  I think 2 seconds is reasonable, but longer starts to feel sluggish, and after 5 seconds, my attention is probably already gone, unless I have a very good reason for going to a site.  What I really don't like waiting for is a site to draw a bunch of text and animations.  That seems unnecessary, and it would be better to hit a button for that stuff than be forced to wait for it to load and be drawn.
