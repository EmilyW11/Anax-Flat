My name is Emily and I live near Bollebygd.  I'm an American living in Sweden for quite a few years now and last year I received Swedish citizenship.  It's beautiful here, but the dark, cold winters don't get any easier.
<br><br>
I run a little webstore, that I created from the ground up on Google's app engine with python, and everything in the store is made by me as well.  Most of my customers live in the US, but I do get a few from around the world.  I've also been doing regular commission work for a French magazine (which I cannot read, unfortunately).

I enjoy web programming and creating web sites.  The programming problems are a nice fun challenge, but I most like applying it to things I need in relation to my store and other interests.  Besides all this I enjoy hiking, berry-picking, cooking, running, painting, bird watching, and spending time with family.
